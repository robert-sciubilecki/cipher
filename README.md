This is a very simple cipher that allows you to encode and decode messages by shifting the alphabet characters
by a custom value. Inspired by 'Ceasar cipher'

I plan to upgrade it by incorporating Vigen√®re cipher idea into the code

This code was written as an exercise project from the '100 days of code' 
bootcamp by Dr. Angela Yu."png](img_2.png) but came out quite different from
what was proposed in the course.
